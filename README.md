CalcByte is a simple, console-based program that performs arithmetic operations, displays numeric values in various low-level representations like IEEE 754, detects key issues such as overflow, and includes guidance text and ASCII drawings to resemble a retro-style interface, making it suitable for educational purposes in understanding number representations and operations.
